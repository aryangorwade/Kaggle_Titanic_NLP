# Kaggle_Titanic_NLP
This is my attempt for the Kaggle Titanic competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview). It is about 76% accurate in predicting the survival of Titanic passengers, depending on their ticket class, gender, age, number of siblings/spouses, number of parents/children, fare, and the port they embarked from.
